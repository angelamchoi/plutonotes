# Plutonotes- General Assembly - SEI Project 2

Plutonotes is a web application that allows you to create notes and post your notes publicly for anyone to see. This application was created for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive (SEI) Program.

## Inspiration for the game
As an online student, I wanted to build an application where students are able to not only keep their notes in one place, but also see how other students are taking their notes. The purpose of the application is to allow students to learn and share their knowledge with the world. 

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongoose
- Materialize CSS
- Oauth
- Deployment on Heroku

## Getting Started
To access the application: 

Install `npm`

Run `npm dev start`


## Next Steps 
The follow are the next steps in improving my application:

- incorporating Markdown format
- add comments and reviews on public notes section
- bookmark favorite notes
- collaboration like google docs
- text-speech option 
- organize my file structure for views folder
- add text editor API for more options for users when taking notes
	
## Development Process
To provide insight of how the browser based game was developed, this section will cover the following topics:

1. Project Requirements
2. Planning
3. Reflection / Difficulties Faced
4. Content of the Working Version


### 1. Project Requirements
The objective of the project was to create a browser based game and include some, if not all, of the topics in the second unit (Back-End Development) of the SEI Program

- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- RESTFUL routing

### 2. Planning
- Wireframe to create mockups
- Entity Relationship Diagram
- User Stories (trello)

- this helped me visualize what I am working towards as well as understand how a user will be navigating through my applicatioon

### 3. Reflection / Diffculties Faced
The back-end is really cool. After building my application, I have a greater appreciation on links and clicking 

Things I enjoyed:
- looking back node.js is incredibly powerful and can do so  much and I love how all my pages connected
- thinking about the user in each page and what i want to show and what the user should be doing
- mongoose queries
- OAuth
    - I feel like as an aspiring developer

Difficulties faced
- Routing
    - making sure the path and url is consistent throughout all my pages 
    - 404 for days
- delete  
- update
    - find and update takes in 2 parameters (1. what you want to find 2. update it)


Lessons Learned
- Organization
- work flow
    - write down steps
- keep it simple
- substance over style
-
